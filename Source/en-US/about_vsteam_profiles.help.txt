TOPIC
    VSTeam Profiles

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Profiles allow you to store account information so you do not have to
    remember your Personal Access Token (PAT). Simply create a profile for
    the desired account and use the profile name to switch to that account
    using the Set-VSTeamAccount function. You can press tab after the
    -Profile parameter to cycle through your profile names.

LONG DESCRIPTION
   Using profiles makes it easier to switch from one account to another.
   Profiles store the URL to the account and authentication information.

   To use a profile with the Set-VSTeamAccount function use the -Profile
   parameter.

   Calling Add-VSTeamProfile with the same account as an existing entry will
   overwrite that entry.

EXAMPLES
    Add-VSTeamProfile -Account demonstrations -Name demonstrations -PersonalAccessToken 7a8ilh6db4aforlrnrqmdrmgap3mziwnga -Version VSTS

    This will add a profile named demonstrations for use with Set-VSTeamAccount using the AzD API.

    Get-VSTeamProfile | Remove-VSTeamProfile -Force

    This will delete all the profiles.

    Set-VSTeamAccount -Profile demonstrations

    This will add the account https://dev.azure.com/demonstrations/
