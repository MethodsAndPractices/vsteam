LONG DESCRIPTION
   You use the New-PSDrive cmdlet to mount a drive to your account.

   You can also use the -Drive parameter of Set-VSTeamAccount to have
   the required command written to the console so you can copy and
   paste the command.

   The provider caches the results. To force a round trip to skip the
   cache use -Force switch with Get-ChildItem

EXAMPLES
   Set-VSTeamAccount -Account '[accountname]' -PersonalAccessToken '[VSTS Tokenvalue]'
   New-PSDrive -Name VSTeamAccount -PSProvider SHiPS -Root 'VSTeam#VSTeamAccount'
   Set-Location VSTeamAccount:
   Get-ChildItem

   Set-VSTeamAccount -Profile '[profileName]' -Drive '[driveName]'

   To map a drive run the following command:
   New-PSDrive -Name driveName -PSProvider SHiPS -Root 'VSTeam#VSTeamAccount'
