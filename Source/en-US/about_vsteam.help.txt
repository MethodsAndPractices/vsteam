TOPIC
    VSTeam

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Provides access to your Azure DevOps (AzD) and Team
    Foundation Server (TFS) from macOS, Linux and Windows.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Add an account using Set-VSTeamAccount and then you can call the rest of the
    functions.

    Use Set-VSTeamDefaultProject so you do not have to provide the -ProjectName
    parameter with the rest of the calls in the module. However, the
    -ProjectName parameter is dynamic and you can use tab completion to cycle
    through all the projects.

    There are many dynamic parameters either call Set-VSTeamDefaultProject or pass
    in -ProjectName as the first parameter to the function. Either will enable
    the rest of the dynamic parameters to query their values.

    All the calls have a default 60 second timeout. Use Set-VSTeamDefaultAPITimeout
    to adjust the timeout.

    Using the Set-VSTeamAPIVersion function you can control which version of the APIs are used.

    PS C:\> Get-VSTeamAPIVersion

    To use different API versions you can update the version in the version table.

    PS C:\> Set-VSTeamAPIVersion -Service Build -Version '4.0'

    You can also use Set-VSTeamAPIVersion to set all the API versions for either
    TFS2017, TFS2017U1, TFS2017U2, TFS2017U3, TFS2018, TFS2018U1, TFS2018U2, TFS2018U3, AzD2019, AzD2019U1 or AzD. TFS2017 is the default.

    PS C:\> Set-VSTeamAPIVersion TFS2018U3
