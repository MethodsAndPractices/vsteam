    VSTeam

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Provides access to your Azure DevOps (AzD) and Team 
    Foundation Server (TFS) from Mac, Linux and PC.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Add an account using Set-VSTeamAccount and then you can call the rest of the 
    functions.

    Use Set-VSTeamDefaultProject so you do not have to provide the -ProjectName 
    parameter with the rest of the calls in the module. However, the 
    -ProjectName parameter is dynamic and you can use tab completion to cycle
    through all the projects.

    Using the Set-VSTeamAPIVersion function you can control which version of the APIs are used.
    
    PS C:\> Get-VSTeamAPIVersion

    To use different API versions you can update the version in the version table.

    PS C:\> Set-VSTeamAPIVersion -Service Build -Version '4.0'

    You can also use Set-VSTeamAPIVersion to set all the API versions for either 
    TFS2017, TFS2018, AzD2019 or AzD. TFS2017 is the default. 

    PS C:\> Set-VSTeamAPIVersion TFS2018
    

EXAMPLES
    Get-VSTeamProject

    This will return all the WellFormed team projects.

    Get-VSTeamProject | Remove-VSTeamProject -Force

    This will delete all the projects in your AzD for TFS. Use with caution.
