Allows you to call any Azure DevOps REST API. All the Auth and Route Structure is taken care of for you. Just provide the parts of the API call you need.  If you need to send a non-standard URL use the -Url parameter.  If the -Url is used the Url is not changed but the header and UserAgent are added for you.
