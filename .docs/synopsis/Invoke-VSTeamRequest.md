Allows you to call any TFS/AzD REST API. All the Auth and Route Structure is taken care of for you. Just provide the parts of the API call you need.  If you need to send a non-standard URL use the -Url parameter.  If the -Url is used the Url is not changed but the header and UserAgent are added for you.
