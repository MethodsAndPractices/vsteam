SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Provides access to your Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Team 
    Foundation Server (TFS) from Mac, Linux and PC.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Add an account using Add-TeamAccount and then you can call the rest of the 
    functions.

    Use Set-DefaultProject so you do not have to provide the -ProjectName 
    parameter with the rest of the calls in the module. However, the 
    -ProjectName parameter is dynamic and you can use tab completion to cycle
    through all the projects.

EXAMPLES
    Get-Project

    This will return all the WellFormed team projects.

    Get-Project | Remove-Project -Force

    This will delete all the projects in your VSTS for TFS. Use with caution.
