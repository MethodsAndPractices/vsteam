## 7.1.4

Combined all the build json files (_types.json, _formats.json and _functions.json) into a single file called config.json in the root folder.
Fixed issue #376

## 7.1.3

Merged [Pull Request](https://github.com/MethodsAndPractices/vsteam/pull/350) from [Daniel Silva](https://github.com/DanielSSilva) which included the following:

- Fixed exception thrown by the Update-VSTeamPullRequest when status is set to "completed", by adding the missing "lastMergeSourceCommit" property to body.

Also added Clear-VSTeamDefaultProjectCount and Set-VSTeamDefaultProjectCount to control the default number of projects returned for tab completion and validation. By default only 100 projects are returned and the 100 returned is nondeterministic. But calling Set-VSTeamDefaultProjectCount you can increase the number of projects returned.


## 7.1.2

Merged [Pull Request](https://github.com/MethodsAndPractices/vsteam/pull/366) from [Jhoneill](https://github.com/jhoneill) which included the following:

Changed Get-VSTeamProject to return all projects by default instead of just the top 100. This change was made to address issue #363. If your project name was not in the top 100 projects validation would fail. Returning all projects can have performance issues. You can set the value for top used by setting a PowerShell default value:

```powershell
$Global:PSDefaultParameterValues["*-vsteam*:top"] = 500
```

Fixed issue #360 by updating the way DateTimes are tested.

## 7.1.1

Fixed bug in Test-VSTeamYamlPipeline by adding a Pipelines version value.

## 7.0.1

Merged [Pull Request](https://github.com/MethodsAndPractices/vsteam/pull/354)

- Fixed bug [353](https://github.com/MethodsAndPractices/vsteam/issues/353)
- Added TriggerInfo to vsteam_lib.Build class

## 7.0.0

## Breaking changes

All classes are moved to a new C# class library.

You must have [.netCore](dot.net) installed to build the class lib on macOS, Linux and Windows.

All types were changed from 'Team.' to 'vsteam_lib.' this will make it easy when moving types from PowerShell to C#.

VSTeamDescriptor is now vsteam_lib.Descriptor and no longer has a Descriptor property. Use the Id, Name or ToString() property in its place.

ProjectName is now a named parameter for most functions. This freed position 0 for other parameters to make functions easier to use.

User2 is now vsteam_lib.User

Removed CUID from vsteam_lib.User.

Removed RequestedFor from vsteam_lib.Release

Disable-VSTeamAgent now requires -Force.

ReleaseIdsFilter changed to ReleaseId on Get-VSTeamApproval

Changed Ids parameter to Id on the following functions to be consistent with other functions:

- Get-VSTeamArea
- Get-VSTeamIteration
- Get-VSTeamGitCommit
- Get-VSTeamClassificationNode

ReClassifyId and Path are now required on Remove-VSTeamArea.

Get-VSTeamGitCommit removed Id alias on RepositoryId parameter.

Renamed parameters on Get-VSTeamBuildTimeline to make it easier to pipe results of Get-VSTeamBuild into Get-VSTeamBuildTimeline. $Id of type Guid is now $TimelineId. $BuildId of type int[] is now $Id.

Removed Type parameter from Get-VSTeamBuildDefinition.

Removed the Top and Skip parameters from Get-VSTeamProcess.

Get-VSTeamMembership now returns a collection. There is no need to .value with results.

### Core changes

The folder structure of the project was changed to support the new C# class library.

All the tests and sample files are under the Tests folder.

There is a new packages folder that contains required libs to build the C# project that do not live in NuGet.

The Build folder is now the .build folder.

Build-Module script builds the class lib project as well.

The C# solution files is in the root of the project vsteam_lib.sln.

The lib is in the classes folder under source and the tests are under the library folder under Tests.

You can now call Get-VSTeamTfvcBranch with no parameters.

Added -force to Remove-VSTeamAccessControlEntry so you don't have to use -confirm:$false. This make it consistent with the rest of the functions

Get-VSTeamUser and Get-VSTeamGroup can now take Descriptor from pipeline.

All unit tests were reviewed and all now use sample files where possible instead of inline objects.

Added -Force to Stop-VSTeamBuild

### Docs changes

Added HelpUri to all public functions

Deleted the docs folder because all docs are now available [here](https://methodsandpractices.github.io/vsteam-docs/)

Added examples to all the help files.

TFS2017U1, TFS2017U2, TFS2017U3, TFS2018U1, TFS2018U2, TFS2018U3 and AZD2019U1.

- Agent Pools
  - Pool1
    - Agent1

      - Ref2

Polished the classes defined for the provider. Also updated some of the functions to return the same classes as the provider. The classes all have a hidden \_internalObj property that contains the raw object returned from the REST API call. Not all the properties of the object are exposed via properties of the class. This property will provide access to them if you need them.

Updated the format.ps1xml files to show more data when the provider is used and to format the provider output to be more consistent with a normal file system. The + and . modes were replaced with d----- and ----- for directories and leafs.

Added a lot of new tests that pushed th code coverage to 99.69%.

## 3.0.1

Huge review of the docs and added support for bearer auth.

Bearer auth will allow you to use the OAuth token created by VSTS during your build and release and not have to create a PAT. Just check the 'Allow scripts to access OAuth token' option on your phase. Then you can add an account by using the -UseBearerToken switch and passing in the \$(System.AccessToken) variable.

```PowerShell
Set-VSTeamAccount -Account mydemos -Token $(System.AccessToken) -UseBearerToken
```

The token is scoped to only allow access to the account running the build or release. To access other accounts you will have to use a personal access token.

## 3.0.0

There is a breaking change with calls to Add-VSTeamKubernetesEndpoint. The acceptUntrustedCerts and generatePfx parameters have been changed from boolean to switch. So any calls that contained:

```powershell
-acceptUntrustedCerts $true -generatePfx $true
```

can be replaced with:

```powershell
-acceptUntrustedCerts -generatePfx
```

There is no need to pass $true.  For calls where you passed $false simply remove the parameter from the call.

This release also contains functions to add a work item and query the work item types. You can not edit the work items yet.

```powershell
Add-VSTeamWorkItem -ProjectName test -WorkItemType Task -Title Test
```

Additional change in this release include more unit tests which resulted in much higher code coverage.

The module now has a dependency on SHiPS for PSDrive support.

You must be running 6.0.0-rc or later on Mac and Linux.
You must be running 5.1.16299.64 or later on Windows.

You can now tab complete your profiles.

## 1.0.5

Added support for Profiles. Now you can store different accounts and PATS as a profile using Add-VSTeamProfile. Then you can call Set-VSTeamAccount with the -Profile parameter and the PAT will be read from the profile. This prevents you having to remember the PAT to switch between accounts. Profiles also store the API version to use with the account.

Added \$Global:VSTeamVersionTable so you can experiment with different versions of the VSTS/TFS APIs. The variable contains the following:

- 'Build' = '3.0'
- 'Release' = '3.0-preview'
- 'Core' = '3.0'
- 'Git' = '3.0'
- 'DistributedTask' = '3.0-preview'

I added new full name extended property to build definition type.

Added support so you can update a project by ID as well as by Name.

## 0.1.33
